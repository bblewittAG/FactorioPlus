Adding more gameplay to Factorio

My idea is to add different challanges to Factorio for an example having no ore generation in-game?
Well you could say wait no ore generation, then how can we make items?
Awnser is easy a generator that creates a small amount of ores for you to use to create your items.

There will more stuff added but my plans are slow.
